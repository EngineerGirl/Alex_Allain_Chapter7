1. Implement the source code that turns numbers into English text.

3. Design a program that finds all numbers from 1 to 1000 whose prime factors, when added
together, sum up to a prime number (for example, 12 has prime factors of 2, 2, and 3, which
sum to 7, which is prime). Implement the code for that algorithm.
